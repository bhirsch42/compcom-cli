# COMPCON-CLI

COMPCON-CLI is a command-line companion for the TTRPG [Lancer](https://massif-press.itch.io/), and an alternative to its web application, [compcon.app](https://compcon.app/#/) for players to use during encounters.

The scope of the project currently excludes editing mechs and characters. Use [compcon.app](https://compcon.app/#/) for the fancy stuff, export your profile, then import it into COMPCOM-CLI for a more 90's hacker-style combat experience.
